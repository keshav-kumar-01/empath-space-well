## Market & Opportunity

### Q1: Why mental health? Why now?

**Answer Template:**
"Mental health is a $240B global market growing at 25% annually. In India specifically:
- 1 in 7 Indians suffers from mental health issues (150M+ people)
- Only 1 psychiatrist per 100,000 people (massive access gap)
- Traditional therapy costs ₹2,000-5,000 per session (unaffordable for most)
- Post-COVID mental health awareness has increased 300%
- Telemedicine guidelines now allow remote mental health services

We're at an inflection point where:
1. Demand is surging
2. Supply is limited
3. Technology can bridge the gap
4. Stigma is reducing (especially among youth)
5. Regulatory environment is supportive"

### Q2: How big is your total addressable market (TAM)?

**Answer:**
"**TAM:** $2.3B (India mental health market)  
**SAM:** $500M (Digital mental health in India)  
**SOM:** $50M (AI-assisted mental wellness for 18-35 age group)

Our initial focus is urban India (400M people) with smartphone penetration, specifically:
- College students (35M)
- Young professionals (80M)
- Parents (50M)

At ₹500/month average, capturing just 0.1% would be ₹20 crore ARR."

### Q3: Who are your competitors?

**Answer:**
"We compete in 3 categories:

**1. AI Mental Health Apps:**
- Wysa (India, $33M raised) - More focused on CBT exercises
- Woebot (US, $90M raised) - Clinical-grade but expensive
- Replika (US) - General companion, not mental health focused

**2. Telehealth Therapy:**
- BetterHelp (US, $250M+ revenue) - Too expensive for India (₹5,000+/session)
- MindPeers (India, B2B focus) - Corporate contracts, not direct-to-consumer

**3. Traditional Therapy:**
- In-person therapists - High cost, limited availability

**Our Differentiation:**
- Hybrid model (AI + human therapists)
- India-specific (language, culture, pricing)
- Community features (peer support)
- Affordable (₹499/month vs ₹8,000+/month for weekly therapy)"

### Q5: What are your unit economics?

**Current Status:** "We haven't launched monetization yet, but here are our projections:

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):**
- Organic (current): ₹0-100 (content marketing, social)
- Paid ads (planned): ₹300-500 per signup
- Target: ₹400 blended CAC

**Lifetime Value (LTV):**
- Essential Plan: ₹499/month × 18 month retention = ₹8,982
- Growth Plan: ₹899/month × 24 month retention = ₹21,576
- Blended LTV (assuming 60% Essential, 40% Growth): ₹14,000

**LTV:CAC Ratio:** 14,000 / 400 = **35:1** (early stage, mostly organic)  
Target with paid marketing: **3:1**

**Gross Margin:**
- AI costs: ~₹50/user/month (with usage)
- Infrastructure: ~₹20/user/month
- Therapist costs: 70% of session revenue
- **Gross Margin: ~70%** (subscription revenue)

**Payback Period:** 2-3 months"

### Q6: What's your path to profitability?

**Answer:**
"We can be profitable at scale. Here's the math:

**At ₹1 Crore MRR (achievable in 18-24 months):**

*Revenue:* ₹1Cr/month

*Costs:*
- AI & Infrastructure: ₹15L
- Therapist payouts: ₹20L
- Team (10 people): ₹30L
- Marketing: ₹25L
- Other: ₹5L

*Total:* ₹95L

**Profit: ₹5L/month (5% margin)**

As we scale, margins improve because:
1. Fixed costs dilute
2. Better AI pricing from volume
3. More efficient marketing
4. Stronger brand = lower CAC"
